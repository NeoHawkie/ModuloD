            <p>“ In 7th Dragon III Code: VFD, the world is engulfed in a time of
                darkness and great peril. In the year 2100, dragons have descended
                upon earth and humanity is at the mercy of these terrifying beasts.
                However, not all is lost. As the protagonist, the player will team
                up with Nodens Enterprises—a video game company dedicated to
                stopping the dragon menace—to become a dragon hunter and eventual
                savior of the universe. Although times are bleak, Nodens Enterprises
                has found a way to tip the scales in favor of mankind: By traveling
                through time to three different eras, the protagonist can upset
                the balance of the dragons’ power. This will give them the edge
                to defeat the True Dragons, and stand a chance against the
                most powerful one of them all… the 7th Dragon: VFD. ”<br></p>

            <p>
                With a total fourth installments of SEGA's fantasy RPG "7th Dragon" series, 7th Dragon III: Code VFD is
                the
                final chapter of the world's story and ties the past, present and future together. <br>
                <br>
                Unlike the past series, the developers Imageepoch did not participate in the creation. The staff of the
                previous
                titles has been changed significantly, with the exception of the character designer Shirow Miwa and the
                composer
                Yuzo Koshiro. <br>
                <br>
                According to SEGA, the game contains the following elements: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>A bleak world and engaging story – The year is 2100, dragons have invaded Earth and are ravaging the
                    human
                    race. As the protagonist, players must team up with "video game company" Nodens Enterprises to
                    become a
                    dragon
                    hunter and save the universe. <br></li>
                <li>Unique settings and time periods – Fortunately for humanity, Nodens Enterprises has found the key to
                    tip
                    the
                    scales in favor of mankind. The protagonist must travel through time to three different eras — the
                    mythical
                    kingdom of Atlantis, futuristic capital of the land of Eden, and present-day Tokyo — in order to
                    defeat the
                    True
                    Dragons and stand a chance against the most powerful one… the 7th Dragon: VFD. <br></li>
                <li>A deep party system and character customization options – All characters are completely customizable
                    from
                    the
                    get-go. Players will be joined by two squad members in the field, and have up to nine characters in
                    their
                    party.
                    With eight classes (such as Samurai, God Hand, Rune Knight, and more), 40 voice options, and 96
                    appearance
                    options, gamers will have plenty of options to develop the perfect dragon hunting team. <br></li>
                <li>Base building with Nodens Enterprises HQ – Fighting dragons is tough work, but at least the team can
                    recuperate at HQ where they can develop skills, collect side quests, and even go on dates. In
                    addition, more
                    floors such as a library, skylounge, and cat café can be added in order to improve HQ. Yes, you read
                    that
                    correctly, it says cat café. <br></li>
                <li>Lots of dragons! – Although there are a variety of enemies to fight, it would be wise to be prepared
                    for
                    the
                    myriad dragons you’ll face. It’ll take careful planning and strategy to defeat these dragons, so
                    choosing
                    the
                    right squad — and right look — is paramount! <br></li>
